description: docs examples rule for DOM
---
When creating examples or implementing logic related to DOM operation, the model should rely on the structure, style, and practices demonstrated in existing PHP files in the `docs/examples/DOM/` directory. This includes using similar initialization patterns, method calls, and result handling as in these examples.
For the folder `docs/examples/DOM/` structure, see the file `docs\examples\DOM\README.md`
Do not use in code ```<br>``` instead of use ```\n```.
If echo line is summary of new code example use at text start symbols ```\n\n```.
For comments in PHP files use English only.
