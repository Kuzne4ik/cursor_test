description: docs examples rule for DOM
---
When creating examples or implementing logic related to DOM operation, the model should rely on the structure, style, and practices demonstrated in existing PHP files in the `docs/examples/DOM/` directory. This includes using similar initialization patterns, method calls, and result handling as in these examples.
For the folder `docs/examples/DOM/` structure, see the file `docs\examples\DOM\README.md`
